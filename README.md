## Abstract 
This exploratory data analysis will be examining data pertaining to the red and white varieties of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine. The data provided presents eleven unique physicochemical characteristics of the wines.  Using these independent variables and armed with the knowledge we gained in STAT 350, we will attempt to determine the relationship (if any) that these variables have with the dependent variable quality.  Our analysis will include graphical representation of the data, a linear regression model to determine the significance of each variable, and residual analysis to understand the intricacies of the data.  Once an initial model is fit, we performed variable selection to determine the most optimal model, and cross validation to test its efficacy.

Note from the group members: We recommend you pour a glass of your favourite wine before diving into our analysis!
